# Hyperskill Python Web Scraper (Nature.com)
This web scraper is currently made for scraping nature.com but can easily be repurposed for other websites. The user inputs the number of pages and category of articles they
would like to get from the website. Each article will be saved with its heading as the title of a .txt file and the body of each article is then saved in the same .txt file.

## Learning outcomes:

After finishing the project, youâ€™ll know how to send HTTP-requests and process the responses, how to work with an external library, library documentation, and how to use it for parsing the website data. You will also find out how to make your program save results to a file with the help of Python.
